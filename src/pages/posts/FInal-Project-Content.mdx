# Final Project Tracker 

I want to make a pair of moveable wings for MIT's Infinite Gala!  
I plan to 3D print the appendages of the wings, with Sirvo motors attached for movement.  
Using a joystick, the user would be able to control the movement.  

ATiny 412s or RP2040?

From BlackOwlStudio, I found a prototype for a wing design that I want to start off testing.

I want to cut out cardboard pieces to test movement soon.
