# #  Hi!  
I'm a senior at MIT studying software engineering. I interned at Amazon as a software engineer last year, and UROPed for two years under Professor Abelson for App Inventor.  
I'm currently doing research with Professsor Stonebraker on improving text-to-SQL models.  

Outside of school, I'm in Camp Kesem and MIT's Asian Dance Team. 

Being in software, I feel like I'm lacking a physical component of my education, so I'm excited for this class to fulfill that.
I'm frequently inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics, video games, and retro pixel art, and want to incorporate those aesthetics into DIY wearable tech and fashion.

Here's a video game I made last year:
